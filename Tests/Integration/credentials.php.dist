 * The integration tests assume the following information has been configured in the AvaTax admin:
 *
 * 1. These tax jurisdictions have been setup:
 *
 * - Michigan (anywhere in Michigan, as it has a 6% flat sales tax)
 * - San Diego, California (we've used the San Diego Zoo: 2920 Zoo Dr, San Diego CA 92101, US)
 *
 * 2. A "D0000000" Tax Code has been created and an associated Tax Rule has been created that marks that Tax Code as
 *    tax exempt for the Michigan tax jurisdiction.

 * To run the integration tests, copy this file to credentials.php and add your credentials
